# Bin-packing-problem
This was for a class assignment about finding a solution to packing a list of various sized rectangles into the most tightly packed square. This solution orders the list by the length of the rectangles, then places them in one column until it reaches the y-value of an estimated square. It returns a list of coordinates of where each rectangle will be placed.
